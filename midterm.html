  <h2>Lisianthus</h2>
  <h3>Lisianthus</h3>
  <p> <img src="images/im1.jpg" alt="im1" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;">
 The Eustoma grandiflorum, more commonly known as Lisianthus, is a flower that blooms annually. They grows natively in warm regions of the Southern United States, Mexico, Caribbean and northern South America. They comes in a variety of colors from pale purple, white, lavender, and even blue violet.<br><br>

This beautiful flower costs around $35 per bundle. If you buy more than 5 bunches at a time, the price will drop to $32 for a single bunch. Sometimes shopkeepers sell them at $2 -$4 per stem.<br><br>

The most common question I get is: "I just bought a lisianthus, now what can I do with it?". Well, you can leave it in the pot and grow it inside if you can put it on a sunny windowsill and water it every day or almost every day. Watch the leaves to see if they are wilting, if they are and you have been watering it enough move it to a larger pot. I use 16 ounce drinking cups for lisianthus, it seems an 8 ounce cup is too small. Make sure there are holes in the bottom of the pot or cup so excess water can drain out. Put the pot in a saucer that will collect the run off. Just because you get water draining out does not mean that the plant is getting enough moisture. When soil drys out it clumps together around the roots and leaves a gap between the soil and the wall of the pot. Water can quickly run down the sides to the bottom and then you think you've watered enough but you haven't.

  <h3>Hydrangea</h3>
  <p>  <img src="images/im2.jpg" alt="im2" style="float:left;width:400px;height:300px;">
      Hydrangea is a genus of 70 species of flowering plants native to southern and eastern Asia and the Americas. The 8th most expensive flowers comes in mostly white blooms, but some are noted for being blue, pink, light purple or violet.<br><br>

The pure blue variety will cost you from $2 to $4.50-$7 per stem. <br><br>
Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) most often at the ends of the stems. Typically the flowerheads contain two types of flowers: small non-showy flowers in the center or interior of the flowerhead, and large, showy flowers with large colorful sepals (tepals). These showy flowers are often extended in a ring, or to the exterior of the small flowers. Plants in wild populations typically have few to none of the showy flowers, while cultivated hydrangeas have been bred and selected to have more of the larger type flowers.</p>
